What is it
-----------
These are a bunch of helper scripts to automate configuration of HC-05 and HC-06 
bluetooth to UART modules I've come along. 

Prereqs
-------
Linux with bluez and stuff. Bash, sed, awk. Usual stuff.

HOWTO: Configure
----------------
Determine if you have a HC-05 or HC-06, connect to your PC.
 
HC-06 use timeout to detect line ends (sic!)
HC-05 use \r\n. 

HC-05 defaults to 38400
HC-06 defaults to 9600

Open up script-hc05 or script-hc6, edit PIN, speed, etc. 
Open up minicom in a separate terminal and set the speed

Without closing minicom run 
./script-hcX device_name

That will do the magic for you, you can inspect minicom for any errors

HOWTO: connect
--------------
You can use the 'connect' script
USAGE: ./connect BDADDR
The script will ping the device until it comes live, 
and then fire up minicom. Useful to catch boot logs as early as possible:
Just run the script prior to poweing up the device. 


HOWTO: manage
-------------
If you have a bunch of devices on debug consoles (like me), you need to manage
this zoo. dbgconsole is here to help. 
Just add 'dbg:' or 'dbg_' prefixes for your bt devices and use dbgconsole. 

e.g.

./script-hc06 dbg:iceshard

Now, you can use 

dbgconsole scan

to scan for devices having dbg prefix in their names, and update the database. 
To connect to a device in the database just run dbgconsole with no args. 
You will be prompted what device to use.
